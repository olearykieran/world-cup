Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Most of the predictions
    proved incorrect - there must have been plenty of upsets that year! 

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would call it at the 100000
    simulation mark since it is still less than one second but results are very similar to the next one up
